        Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species, but has
        come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without
        being introduced by humans.[1] Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems.
        Deserts, forests, rainforests, plains, grasslands, and other areas,
        including the most developed urban areas, all have distinct forms of
        wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals
        that are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that much
        wildlife is affected by human activities.[2]

        Humans have historically tended to separate civilization from wildlife
        in a number of ways, including the legal, social, and moral senses. Some
        animals, however, have adapted to suburban environments. This includes
        such animals as domesticated cats, dogs, mice, and rats. Some religions
        declare certain animals to be sacred, and in modern times, concern for
        the natural environment has provoked activists to protest against the
        exploitation of wildlife for human benefit or entertainment.

        Global wildlife populations have decreased by 68% since 1970 as a result
        of human activity, particularly overconsumption, population growth and
        intensive farming, according to a 2020 World Wildlife Fund's Living
        Planet Report and its Living Planet Index measure, which is further
        evidence that humans have unleashed a sixth mass extinction event.[3][4]
        According to CITES, it has been estimated that annually the
        international wildlife trade amounts to billions of dollars and it
        affects hundreds of millions of animal and plant specimen.[5]
